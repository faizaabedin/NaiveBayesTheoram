# NaiveBayesTheoram
- Naive Bayes is a popular algorithm in data science.
- It is used to predict the probability of a class based on given attributes values. This algorithm is mostly used for classification and with problems having multiple classes. 
- The classification is best done for atributes with nominal values. 
- Naive Bayes theoram is good for prediction beacause if the attributes used for caculations have missings values then thay can be avoided during calulations and the prediction would still be correct.
