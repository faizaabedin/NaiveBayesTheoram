# NaiveBayesTheoram
- Naive Bayes is a popular algorithm in data sscience.
- It is used to predict the probability of a class based on given attributes values. This algorithm is mostly used for classification and with problems having multiple classes. 
- This is classifications is best done in nominal values. 
- Naive Bayes theoram is good for prediction beacause if the attributes used for caculations have missings values then thay can ve avoided during calulations and the prediction would be still corect.
